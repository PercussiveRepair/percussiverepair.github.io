I believe it fits the mould very well:\r\n* It has an established, secure and most importantly, fast, master-minion setup \r\n* It has built in scheduling capability both for the master and separately for the minions.\r\n* It already has built in support for piping whatever comes back from your minion status checks into graphite, mysql/postgres/sqlite, cassandra/mongo/redis/couch, etc in its [Returners](https://salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/returners/index.html)\r\n* It can act on event on the minions using it's [events](https://salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/event/index.html) and [reactor](https://salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/reactor/index.html) systems\r\n\r\nI've started doing some testing of my own on this, but I'd be very interested in feedback. jay (at) percussiverepair.net\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
